    'description' => 'With over 9 years of experience in software development, I help companies build modern, scalable, and results-oriented applications. My journey began in 2011 and, by 2015 at SC Serviços, I was leading teams and delivering solutions that transformed the business — including migrating a 30-year-old legacy CRM with 5,000 users into a modern platform. I also built and managed a team of 12 developers working on strategic projects.

Later, I founded Unitibox, where I developed software for the agribusiness sector, focusing on process automation and, more recently, solutions powered by Artificial Intelligence.

I work with Laravel, Python, Vue js, MongoDB, MySQL, and large-scale databases, always aiming to deliver systems that boost competitiveness and eliminate bottlenecks.'];
